Welcome! I am a 6th-year PhD candidate at Dartmouth University. I am on the job market until recently. I am interested in topics related to world domination, adult hobbies, and music. I use both lab experiments and tools from an implied dialogue. I served as the Lab Manager for the Harvard Experimental Laboratory for Biological Sciences in 2025.

Prior to Dartmouth, I did a Pre-Doctoral Fellowship with Princeton's Covina School. I received my B.A. in Legal Studies and in Theater Arts from UCSC in 2020.
